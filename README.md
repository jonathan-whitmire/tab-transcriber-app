Original web based app used to input guitar/bass tablature information to save and use on a gig

I'm using React.js to create a web based app that takes in guitar or bass tablature information and creates a musical tablature to print or use on a tablet. The user clicks on buttons that are located on a picture of a fretboard. That number is sent up from the that component to the parent App component and then back down to the Tablature component. Then the user clicks on a button associated with the rhythm of that note from the rhythm component. Then the app places the number on the tablature that corresponds with the string, and it places the note below the number under the tab. It is a work in process.
